## Neovim
The initial nvim config was taken from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim).
Nvim plugin space is fast moving.
It was time consuming maintaining the config, structure, options, tweaks, plugins, etc. so I decided to movie to [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) nvim distro.
I will return to maintaining the custom config someday.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Customize hyprland
- [ ] Make tmux integrated
- [ ] Maintain custom nvim
- [ ] Add vim config
- [ ] Add nix
